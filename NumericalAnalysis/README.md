# Numerical analysis

Numerical analysis is a branch of mathematics that deals with the development and implementation of algorithms for solving mathematical problems. It involves the use of numerical methods to approximate solutions to problems that cannot be solved analytically. Numerical analysis is used in a wide range of fields, including engineering, physics, finance, and computer science. Some common applications of numerical analysis include solving differential equations, optimization problems, and linear algebraic equations.Numerical analysis is a branch of mathematics that deals with the development and implementation of algorithms for solving mathematical problems.

In sample code:

```python
print("hello world")
```

```octave
i = 1;
FA = f(a);
```
